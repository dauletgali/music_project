<section id="about">
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        SPM Creative Company USA was born from the convergence of music, cinema, and creative direction.
        We are a house of creation that treats art as language, purpose, and presence. With work that has
        circulated through Brazil, Latin America, the United States, Europe, and Asia, we bring a global
        perspective shaped on stage, in the studio, and behind the camera.
        <br><br>
        Gabriel A. T. Arevalo, João Paulo Faria and Marco Antônio do Carmo Pontes combine musical direction,
        audiovisual craft and orchestral expertise to build works with artistic depth, aesthetic clarity and
        solid delivery.
        <br><br>
        Every project begins with identity, narrative and intention. We combine sound, image, artistic direction
        and strategy to transform visions into something seen, heard, and recognized.
